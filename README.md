# Notes Repository

Welcome to the **Notes** repository! This repository contains all the notes I take as I study various topics. I will be regularly updating this repo with new information as I continue learning.

This repository serves as a centralized collection of my study notes. Initially, I write my notes in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), a powerful and flexible note-taking application. After completing my notes in Notion, I export them to this GitHub repository to make them easily accessible and version-controlled.

Feel free to browse through the notes in this repository. Each topic is organized into its own directory, and notes are written in Markdown for easy readability.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

Happy studying!
